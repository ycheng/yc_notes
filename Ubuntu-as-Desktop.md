* Gnome Terminal: Ctrl-Shift-C / Ctrl-Shift-V to copy/paste is annonying. I change it to Alt-c / Alt-v
  * How: Gnome Terminal Menu -> Edit -> Preference -> Key -> Change it !

For Chinese use:
* use shift to switch between English / Chinese is not good for me. I hist Shift-Space from time to time
  * I change back to Ctrl-Space to switch Pure English vs Chinese mode.
